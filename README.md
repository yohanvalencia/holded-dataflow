# Note:
I've built this project to learn how to create bindings between rust and python.

# Goals
- Create a PyPi package
- Create stub files
- Port several functions from python to rust
- Run a stress test with n1-standard-1 and n1-highcpu-2 and check if there is no memory leak.

# Description
Rust ingestion logic to reduce CPU usage
This code is made for testing purposes only. Not being used in production environment.
